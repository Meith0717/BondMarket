## **Introduction**
This program is designed to manage your finances within a group 
or relationship. If you and your partner want to share your 
finances fairly, this program is for you. It keeps track of your 
monthly expenses and calculates each person's debt at the end of 
the month. It supports up to 10 people, so it's great for 
managing finances within a group.
## **First steps**
Download the latest release [Installer.exe](https://github.com/Meith0717/BondMarket/releases/) and follow the steps. After 
installing, open BondMarket. Now the UI appears. This is divided 
into three parts: 
![V4.1](https://github.com/Meith0717/BondMarket/blob/main/Images/BM_1.png)
1. This is the table where you can see your saved entries. These 
are sorted by date.
2. Here you can create new entries or delete them. Enter your 
data and press **Add (ENTER)** to add them. To delete an entry, 
select it by double clicking on it in the table and finally press 
**Delete (DELETE)**.
3. This area displays the calculation tools and settings.

After you have entered data in the table, you can save it with 
**CTRL-S** or via the menu **App -> Save**. If you don't do this 
and close the app, you will be warned. The contents of the 
expenditure and debt windows are automatically updated after 
adding new data. 

## **Some tips**
- You can change the appearance of the UI between light and dark..
- The entries in the table are filtered by months and years to get a better overview.
- If you want to share the same entries in a group, you can 
share a new ***.pkl** file via **File -> New File** in a folder 
within a cloud service of your choice. To open this shared file, 
simply click on **File -> Open File** and open the desired file.
